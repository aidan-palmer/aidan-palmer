I'm a computer science student with a strong interest in software development, specifically Linux and other operating system development. Currently learning C in my spare time since my university just decided to get rid of the class where we'd normally learn C and assembly language. 
I have experience developing software in Python and Java.
I also have some experience in data structures and algorithms. I have listed my progress on Leetcode.com below.
